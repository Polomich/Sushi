# Title
Sushi App

# Description
Website all about sushi with a bonus animation

# Medium
HTML, CSS, JavaScript

# Process and Intention
Demonstrates some client-side performance techniques:

1. use the Fetch API
2. lazy load images using the Intersection Observer API
3. create an animation using `requestAnimationFrame` (rAF)

The website was made to reduce the time load of the images. Each image only loads when it is within view. The animation at the bottom of the website should move forever without interfering with any other activity on the website.
